Since all 3 are unable to handle a directed, negative weighted graph.The Prims and Kruskals algorithm wont work for undirected graph.Dijkstra algorithm cant be used gor directed graph.

I used C programming language beacuse i am working with that from past 3 semesters and i had learnt data structers in C too.


The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.
It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
